                        <p>Yae Sakura was born in Yae-gu, Shinano, Japan, and is estimated to be a village formed by Yae Tribe. The Yae family has a potential to develop a natural stigmata that allows communication with the spirits.</p>

                            of the prison, almost all of the property was frozen. This incident has had a major impact on Mei, and it has made her cheerful personality a bit solitary.</p>
                        <p>She is an elder-sister (onee-chan) type, and very good at taking care of others. Kiana and Bronya look up to her a lot. When she is excited, she cannot control her excitement. The result of that is usually her blowing up the whole

                            remembered anything about herself except for her name, the people who ran the orphanage randomly chose January 1, 2000 as her birthday.</p>

                            needed if she completed the tests. Otto would later adopt A-310 as his granddaughter and gave her the name 'Theresa'</p>
